# Problem Definition:

Efforts have been made for over a decade by public and private sectors to increase the number of individuals entering the cyber workforce, particularly in cyber security. Various initiatives, such as Black Girls in Cyber and the Federal Cyber Defense Skilling Academy, aim to increase participation and reskill existing workers. However, a longitudinal study by the U.S. Census Bureau in 2020 shows a continuous decline in STEM field participation, with the employment rate of Computer and Information Science students from George Mason University in STEM occupations dropping from 53% to 14% over ten years. It is unclear whether these STEM field losses, including in cyber and cybersecurity, disproportionately affect historically marginalized communities. Higher representation of certain demographics in the departures may indicate underlying issues within the STEM field that contribute to individuals from diverse ethnic or gender groups leaving. Studying the migration between fields can provide valuable insights for hiring decisions and understanding employee retention in the industry.

There is a serious shortage of cybersecurity professionals resulting in cybersecurity gaps and risk to businesses and government agencies.   One key factor in this shortage has been the departure of cybersecurity professionals from the industry.  Surveys have highlighted many reasons for workforce dissatisfaction and departures; However, the analysis of these factors is incomplete. 

This project will conduct a detailed exploratory examination of the main factors that contribute to the exodus of cyber workers individual specialties and work roles in cybersecurity. 
# Project Goals
Project Scope: Conduct exploratory analysis of Cyber workforce in National Capital Region
Review Cyber WorkRoles and Quality of Life Factors in the DC/Maryland/Virginia Area

Examine specialty areas and work roles in cybersecurity specialty categories
Collect data on the employment statistics 
Collect quality of life factors including crime, GINI factors, commute, average salary in the NCR. 
Identify key intrinsic and extrinsic factors associated with cyber employment in the region.

Identify individuals from the DC/Maryland/Virginia area, via a resume review, who:
- Have experience in a cyber field.
- Assess the extent to which their knowledge, skills, and abilities (KSAs) align with NICE work roles.
- Determine if they are currently seeking employment in another field.
- Record graduation information, including the year and degree obtained, from college or university for individuals with a STEM background.

Identify individuals from the DC/Maryland/Virginia area, via a resume review, who:
- Lack experience in a cyber field but are actively seeking employment in the cyber field.
- Evaluate the compatibility of their KSAs with NICE work roles.
- Document graduation details, including the year and degree obtained, for individuals who have completed their education at a college or university.

# Problem Definition:

Efforts have been made for over a decade by public and private sectors to increase the number of individuals entering the cyber workforce, particularly in cyber security. Various initiatives, such as Black Girls in Cyber and the Federal Cyber Defense Skilling Academy, aim to increase participation and reskill existing workers. However, a longitudinal study by the U.S. Census Bureau in 2020 shows a continuous decline in STEM field participation, with the employment rate of Computer and Information Science students from George Mason University in STEM occupations dropping from 53% to 14% over ten years. It is unclear whether these STEM field losses, including in cyber and cybersecurity, disproportionately affect historically marginalized communities. Higher representation of certain demographics in the departures may indicate underlying issues within the STEM field that contribute to individuals from diverse ethnic or gender groups leaving. Studying the migration between fields can provide valuable insights for hiring decisions and understanding employee retention in the industry.

# Project Goals
